# **BMI Calculator Assignment**

Your task is to create a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator using Python. Follow the steps below to complete the assignment:

## 1. Create Variables
- Ask the user to input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in cms).
- Store these inputs in variables.

## 2. BMI Formula
Use the following formula (code) to calculate BMI:
```python
BMI = weight / (height ** 2)
```

#If Statements
Use if, elif, and else statements to determine the user's BMI category:

If the BMI is less than 18.5, display: "You are underweight."
If the BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9, display: "You are normal weight."
If the BMI is between 25 and 29.9, display: "You are overweight."
If the BMI is 30 or above, display: "You are obese."

#Output
Display the user's BMI and the appropriate weight category using a print statement.
If the user is underweight or overweight, print the formula used to calculate BMI for them to see.

#Optional Enhancements
Add error handling to ensure the inputs are valid numbers.
Add an option for the user to input their weight in pounds and height in inches, and convert these to metric units.
